Hiya,

If the target is 10k, then we can add cores or memory but not both :

    256G / 32 cores = 8G per core       £6560
    256G / 48 cores = 5G per core       £9850

    512G / 32 cores = 16G per core      £9240
    512G / 48 cores = 10G per core     £12530

I agree with Nigel, it looks like the AMD with 48 cores and 256G memory is the best match.

Out of interest, why does it cost an extra £190 to add 256G memory to the AMD motherboard ?

    Upgrade Intel to 512GB DDR4 2666Mhz ECC Registered memory - add £2,490.00
    Upgrade AMD to 512GB DDR4 2666Mhz ECC Registered memory - add £2,680.00

The memory chips themselves are the same speed, and the AMD CPU has a slower internal clock.

Cheers,
-- Dave
