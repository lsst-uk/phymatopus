    # TODO
    # Create the initial schema.
    # Create the Kafka connect process ..

    #
    # Split the data directories ..
    # http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/4.0/getting_started/configuring.html

        The following yaml properties control the location of directories:

            data_file_directories: one or more directories where data files are located.
            commitlog_directory: the directory where commitlog files are located.
            saved_caches_directory: the directory where saved caches are located.
            hints_directory: the directory where hints are located.

        For performance reasons, if you have multiple disks, consider putting commitlog and data files on different disks.
