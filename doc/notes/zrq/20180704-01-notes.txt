        Generate a Healpix coverage map by adding dots to a png pixel map in real time.
        Optinally, cache the maps in memory to speed processing.
        For typical stream, a small set of higher level maps will recieve multiple updates.

        Generate a VOTable from selected fields.
        Optionally, stream the output row at a time.

        key->value ObjectStore NO JOINS
        Objects can have Lists of things linked to them.
            Customer has a List of Orders 

            Position has a history of Events

        For wide JOINS use GreenPlumb.
        Integrate the two for best of both.
