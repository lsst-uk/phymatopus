    Email from Masci, Franco (Frank) <fmasci@ipac.caltech.edu>

        The alert packet Avro schema will be updated to include two new columns in the candidate block:

            drb : RealBogus quality score from Deep-Learning-based classifier; range is 0 to 1 where closer to 1 is more reliable
            drbversion : version of Deep-Learning-based classifier model used to assign RealBogus (drb) quality score

        This will complement the existing Random-Forest-based score: rb, rbversion.

        The Deep-Learning-based implementation is courtesy of Dmitry Duev of Caltech. Stay tuned for more information on how to use these scores when the new schema is deployed.

        New schema files (v3.3) with an example avro packet and json equivalent reside under:
        http://web.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/fmasci/ztf/avroschema_v3.3/

        This update will be effective:
        **June 19, 2019, 00hr UTC**
        (June 18, 2019, 16:00hr PDT).


    New schema is maintained user's home directory.
