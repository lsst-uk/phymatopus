# System status metadata.
    
    * Cloudy at Palomar so no data

        * No Kafka stream published
        * No selection option in Grafana interface
        * Zero size tar.gz file in the archive

    Hard to distinguish between system failure, missing data, broken connection and nothing observed.

    System status Kafka channel - long running topic.
    
    Telescope status - ACTIVE, INACTIVE etc
    Telescope pointing - ZTF field / ra,dec ..

        ACTIVE + pointing = observation
        Distinguish between (we looked and didn't see any transients) and (we didn't look).

        [

            {
            type_uri: 'http://example.org/ztf-telescope-status'
            date:   '20180709T05:00'
            status: 'ACTIVE'
            }

            {
            type_uri: 'http://example.org/ztf-camera-status'
            date:   '20180709T05:00'
            status: 'ACTIVE'
            }

            {
            type_uri: 'http://example.org/ztf-telescope-pointing'
            start:    '20180709T05:00'
            wcs_geom: 'WCS (pointing) geometry'
            field_id: 'ZTF field ID'
            }




        ]


    Kafka topics - topic-start, topic-end
        Can we get this from the Kafka internal topics ?
        Insulate us from changes to the topic name syntax.

        [

            {
            type_uri: 'http://example.org/ztf-topic-start'
            topic_name: 'ztf_20180709_programid1'
            start_date: '20180709T05:00'              <-- datetime of processing start or first event ?
            }

            {
            type_uri: 'http://example.org/ztf-topic-end'
            topic_name: 'ztf_20180709_programid1'
            stop_date: '20180709T12:00'              <-- datetime of processing done or last event ?
            }

        }



    Propose - Kafka stream of 'system status' messages.
    Format is plain text JSON (or Avro if needed).
