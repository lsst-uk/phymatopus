    https://opencredo.com/blogs/fulfilling-promise-apache-cassandra/

        "Cassandra is ideally suited to relatively immutable data where updates
        and deletions are the exception rather than the rule."
        "This includes handling high-throughput firehoses of immutable events such
        as personalisation, fraud detection, time series and IOT/sensors."

        A Cassandra DBA needs to understand:

            * Distributed systems and consensus
            * Java Virtual Machine tuning
            * Various Cassandra production support processes such as compaction
            * Monitoring and alerting requirements

        Certain operations will also require manual intervention from ops:

            * Node Failure. Where a node goes down it must be addressed manually.
            * Failed operations. In some cases, updates and writes may fail to
              synchronise across the cluster correctly. Regular repairs are required.

        These gaps can certainly be filled with online training and will definitely
        benefit from at least one operationally experienced individual within your
        organisation “taking on” Cassandra.


    https://opencredo.com/blogs/cassandra-data-modelling-patterns/

        "We have noticed that Cassandra data modelling problems are the most
        consistent cause of Cassandra failing to meet their expectations."
        "Data modelling is one of the most complex areas of using Cassandra
        and has many considerations."


        * Likely partition sizes.
            A single partition will always be stored in its entirety on a single node,
            therefore, it must be small enough to fit on that node accounting for free
            space required for compaction. For this reason, it is important to understand
            compaction and choose the right compaction strategy.

        * Keeping partition data bounded.
            If the amount of data in a single partition is likely to become too big,
            adding an additional partitioning column will limit its growth potential.
            For example, additionally bounding a partition of events by time in addition
            to type would provide a reasonable guarantee of reasonable partition size.
            That said, it is important to carefully choose the time granularity best
            suited to a particular use case.

        * Partition key cardinality.
            Choosing a column with a reasonably large number of unique values (high cardinality)
            is important to keep partition sizes small. However, it is important to balance
            this with the aim of one partition ideally being able to satisfy each query.

        #
        # Cassandra partitions are a different shape to Kafka partitions.
        # Kafka aggregates multiple partitions to form one stream.
        # Cassandra works best if a query can be satisfied by data in one partition.
        #

        #
        # What if ...we had a partition per day ?
        # Use something else to aggregate across the days ?
        # Day is perhaps too small .. partition per month ?
        #

        #
        # So far few of the queries from our users are region based.
        # Apart from cross match queries ...
        #

        #
        # Date indexed data (month per partition) ?
        # Region indexed data (htmid or zone) ?
        #

        #
        # Query constraints on PRIMARY KEY work well.
        # Query constraints on anything else ... not so.
        #

        #
        # Multiple copies of the data, separate tables with different indexing.

    Time Series Stream Processing with Spark and Cassandra
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBWLzB0FMX4&list=PL-x35fyliRwif48cPXQ1nFM85_7e200Jp

        Data distributed by key e.g 0-99.
        Each node owns a range of keys 0-9, 10-19, 20-21 etc.

        Two 'virtual' data centers, operational and analytics.
        Application writes data into operational data center.
        Cassandra replicates from operational into analytics data center.
        Spark deployed on same nodes as analytics data center.
        Spark reads from local co-located Cassandra node.
        Spark writes to local co-located Cassandra node.
        Cassandra replicates results from analytics back to operational data center.
        Application reads from operational data center.

        (HDFS + Spark) is faster than (Cassandra + Spark)
