LSST:UK notes

    Data meeting in April
    2.5 day workshop on wiki
    Phase B planning

    Mostly users installing on their own laptops.
    Useful to have some local data too.

    UKIDSS in qserv works
    \n in some fields ?
    
    Amazingly slow - order of magnitude slower
    Possible causes:
        * SQLServer vs MySQL
        * qserv slowing mySQL
        * Hardware issue ?

    Standard tweaks to MySQL config 
        * Flushing the cache before the test
        * qserv +4x faster than SQLServer
        * qserv +2x .. -5x slower SQLServer

    Stelios tests
    
        * Variable results, some faster, some slower.
        * 

    Andy making progress on documents about VOEvent

    Anndy to Belfast
        Pesto - spectroscopic follw up of transients
        What do we want to talk about
        Belfast need help with engineering
        
        Need something to show collab working
        
        * Test alerts injesting into database .. ?
        * Description of current analysis PanStars/Atlas
        * How would that apply to LSST ?
        
        * Criteria for interesting/junk
        * Dump of transients from PanStarrs/Atlas
        * Feed into Comet/Antares


        * What do they want from LSST ?
        * Belfast 8th April ?


        OpenStack started billing.
        A bit chaotic
        Cost for running CPU, memory and disc spaces.
