    Two steps to crossmatch process
    
    1) list the htmid triangles that are inside or overlap with the target area (circle)
            - sherlock does this using a Python wrapper around the C++ code from JHU.
            - could we do this using the Java code from JHU ?

    2) find all the sources inside each of those triangles
            - currently done using a IN query on an SQL database
            - is there a case for just having an in memory tree of arrays ?
