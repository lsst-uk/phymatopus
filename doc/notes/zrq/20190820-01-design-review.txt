High-throughput computation

    "These frameworks enable exactly the computations what we want,
     but their resource strategy is exactly what we donâ€™t want"

    Actually, these may be a good fit for cloud compute.

API Aspect - Requirements and Design

    VO standards wherever applicable
    Active in the IVOA to adapt the standards to meet LSST requirements

    TAP/ADQL - Adopting IVOA and CADC data models.
    Implementation is based on CADC code base (Java which is a departure for LSST)

    SODA - Server-side Operations
        Provides image manipulation/re-projection
    SIA  - Simple Image Access

    Planning to provide both VOSpace and WebDAV, allowing users to choose

    Nothing yet on DataLink, although I suspect that will follow soon.

    Not much detail on Auth/Auth yet.
        Watching and participating in the IVOA work but, not adopting them yet.
        LSST developer Christine Banek is vice chair of IVOA Grid&WebServices.

    Database - Spatially sharded qserv
    User data in conventional database
        Probably Oracle because of politics and history
        User data in a separate database, so they will need something like Spark to join user data with main archive.

    Data Butler
        Data archive provides abstraction layer that enables users to write portable code - huge benefit.

    Containerized deployment
        LSST have been big on containers for a long time.
        Christine Banek (IVOA Grid&WebServices) is very keen on K8s.
